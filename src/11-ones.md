# Ones and Zeroes
_I lied.  This isn't about zeroes at all._

Rolling a 1 at anytime is known as a botch.  Botches cancel out successes.  Rolling more botches than successes means that, not only does the action you are rolling for fail, but it fails miserably.  And the more botches you roll, the worse it is.  Imagine being in the middle of a bank heist; you botch your lockpick roll, rolling 1, 1, 3, 5 â€“ no successes and two botches.  The automatic alarm is triggered and the cops are on their way.  What if you rolled 1, 1, 1, 3, 5?  The alarm is triggered, police on their way, and the security guard you didn't see turns the corner and is now aiming his gun at you.  You get the picture.  Botches are never good and can change the direction of a story to being a great escape.
