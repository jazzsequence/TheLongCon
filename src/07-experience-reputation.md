# Experience and Reputation
There are two ways your character will advance through the game: experience and reputation.  

_Experience_ reflects how much your character has learned over the course of a campaign and is measured in XP.  XP can be used to buy skills at a rate of 5XP : 1 Skill point.

_Reputation_ is word on the street.  When you pull something off, and do it well, people start talking.  Inevitably people (other grifters and cons) hear about your deeds.  Get enough Reputation Points and it can boost your Rep.  Reputation is different from Rep (although they are related); Reputation _specifically_ refers to your reputation in the underworld and does not affect how much the authorities know about you (i.e. the details of pulling a really good grift will most likely elude the authorities unless they stage a sting).  However, racking up Reputation points will give add to your Rep score, which _is_ representative of how much the authorities (and anyone else with their ear to the ground) might know about you.

Reputation is the cumulative total of Buzz points.  For each skill you may earn Buzz points.  When you roll all successes on 4 or more dice, you will earn 1 Buzz point for that skill.  When you earn 10 Buzz points, you get an additional point in that skill.

Reputation is the total of all Buzz points across all skills.  You cannot earn Buzz on Rep, but you will receive 1 point in Rep for every 50 points of Reputation.

At the GM’s discretion, you may also earn Reputation points for other deeds in game.  These do not give you bonuses in any skills (except Rep), but signify when something you did was worthy of boosting your image in the criminal underground.  For this reason, Thinkers will often get Reputation points for pulling off a successful con, but by no means are Thinkers the only ones able to earn Reputation points.

You earn Experience points throughout the game, generally at the end of a section, game session, or other break also at the GM’s discretion (alternate rules apply in GM-less mode).  You may use XP to buy points in skills at a rate of 5 x the current level (e.g. 5 x 1 point = 5XP, 5 x 2 points = 10XP, etc.).  If you have no points in a skill, it costs 15 XP to buy the first point in that skill _and_ it must be justified in-game (a mentorship, an attempt to use the skill, shadowing an expert in said skill).  New recruits are often “shown the ropes” by more senior grifters, so justifying a new skill means that you need to plan ahead and work with your fellow players.

XP can also be spent to lower the difficulty of a roll.  3XP will subtract 1 difficulty level up to a total of 3 difficulty levels or 9XP.
