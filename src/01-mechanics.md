# Basic Mechanics

You have points in any of the listed skills.  Each point in a given skill gives you 1d10 to roll for that skill.  

Rolls are always difficulty 6 plus modifiers.  The level of success in any roll is determined by the number of successful rolls; so if you only have 1 point in a stat, you can never get more than 1 success in any roll for that skill.
