# Classes
While there are no formal rules saying that a grifter is ever limited to his or her particular position, frequently grifters will migrate toward specific areas of expertise.  In The Long Con we refer to these as Classes.  A well rounded crew will have at least one of the following Classes:

## The Thinker
The brains of the operation.  The Thinker is the one who most frequently comes up with the plan.  The Thinker is usually the leader and, as such, the one most likely to earn Rep points from a successful (or unsuccessful) job.  While there’s no hard and fast list of skills most applicable to the Thinker, high rankings in Read, Fasttalk and a fair amount of Luck can go a long way.

## The Roper 
The Roper lays the groundwork for the con by finding a mark, feeling them out, and dropping some breadcrumbs.  If the mark takes the bait, the Roper can reel them in, introducing the mark to the Inside Man and any other players who will be important to the con.  The Roper needs to be an expert at reading people, so it is essential to have good scores in Read and Body Language.  They also do a lot of talking, so should be proficient in Fasttalk, Charm, Persuasion or Lie.

## The Fixer
The Fixer is the go-to person to pull all the details and technical aspects to the con together.  The Fixer may be required to hack complex security systems and video surveillance, acquire (or build) gadgetry to assist with a job,  gather a team of extras or allies to play bit parts, or secure physical locations such as offices or meeting rooms.  As such, a Fixer needs to be highly rounded and skilled in a variety of talents not the least of which being Tech, Charm and Connections.

## The Lure
Every angler needs bait that’s suited to the specific kinds of fish he’s trying to reel in.  That’s where the Lure comes in.  Frequently female but more than just a pretty face, the Lure needs to have precisely that which the mark wants – or be what the mark wants – and stand just out of reach to string the mark along and into the hustlers’ trap.  The Lure needs to be a Chameleon, able to spot weakness a mile away and exploit it.  In addition to Attractiveness, the Lure should also be adept in the social skills of Charm, Persuasion, Read and Body Language.

## The One on the Inside
Much like a Receiver in a retail store waits for an incoming shipment of merchandise, the Inside Man lies in waiting for the Roper to bring the mark in.  The One on the Inside is the key player who pulls off the con and takes the money.  There may be multiple Inside People in a given con, depending on the grift.  The One on the Inside needs to be a jack-of-all-trades, no single skill or group of skills is really any more important than any other, since they will need to adapt to a variety of situations.  Thus, the One on the Inside role may be passed around based on the crew’s strengths and weaknesses.
