# Skills

## Attractiveness
How good you look.  No points in this does not mean you’re ugly, just average.  Many points in Attractiveness can be attributed to raw sex appeal, how well you dress, etc.  Too many points in Attractiveness, however, is not always a good thing; some marks may be intimidated by overly beautiful con artists, and a high Attractiveness score means it would be that much more difficult to tone down your appearance to play a particular role.

## Charm
You have a way with words that never fails to flatter.  There aren’t many instances when Charm would not be a boon (unless trying to impress or fit in with thugs or gangsters).

## Misdirection
An important rule of the con is misdirection – have the mark looking at big movements over here while you make a subtle switch over there.  This can apply to a particular way with words or actual physical misdirection and sleight of hand.

## Tech
It’s important to be up on the latest gadgets.  A sucker is born every minute and a lot of them are sitting at home in front of their computers in their underwear.  In order to remain current, it’s important to be aware of the latest trends in technology, if not outright expert in all of them.

## Lore
You have a long memory of historic cons and con artists.  This valuable information can be the key to repeating the mistakes of those who came before you or learning from those mistakes and pulling off the cons those legendary grifters failed to achieve.

## Persuasion
Your way with words makes people trust you inherently, and follow your lead.  Maybe you can talk down a suicidal man or maybe you can sell a junker for six figures – either way, your golden tongue is key to closing the deal.

## Intimidation
When all else fails, there’s always physical violence.  It’s not elegant, but in certain situations it can get the job done.  Intimidation comes in many forms, from physical intimidation to a certain tone of voice or cadence.  Your survival may depend on your expertise in knowing what form of intimidation fits best in which situation.

## Sparkle
You have a certain _je ne sais pas_.  There isn’t anything in particular, there’s just some sort of magical quality about you that makes people like you.  Maybe it’s the elfish sparkle in your eye when you grin, or maybe it’s the way you smile.  Sparkle can be the thing that tips a skeptical mark over the top if you are able to fill their imagination with dreams of sugarplums.

## Luck
Lady Luck is the great equalizer, the one thing no one can run from.  You know when it’s run out, but you never know when that day will come.  Good con artists rely on much more than luck, but being lucky never hurt anyone.

## Empathy
Occasionally it’s important to be able to meet the mark halfway to get inside their head and really understand them.  Your ability to empathize with a mark can clue you into details you might have missed otherwise, or offer insights about a situation.

## Lie
Your parents never found out about all those times you snuck out of the house.  Your former employer never realized it was you who was lifting cash out of the till.  Being able to tell a boldface lie directly to someone’s face can be helpful in a casual game of poker or when the cops are hot on your trail.

## Sleight-of-Hand
Sleight-of-Hand measures how well you are able to obfuscate gestures and movements.  Simple parlor tricks and pickpocketing benefit from this skill, although it is still possible to pick a mark’s pocket without any Sleight-of-Hand (see: Misdirection).

## Lockpick
Your ability to pick locks including combination locks.  The higher the score in Lockpick, the better the chances of cracking more complicated locks.

## Sneak
Your ability to move unseen.  Sneak is useful in heists but can also be used to augment things like pickpocketing or making a clean getaway.

## Connections
A high score in Connections increases your ability to find allies that can be called in to help with a con.  Especially useful for Fixers, the more well-connected you are, the easier it is to find information or recruit valuable resources for a job.

##Read
Being able to “read” a person is an invaluable asset in choosing a potential mark.  The Read skill focuses on discernable clues about the type of person a potential mark is based on visual clues or body language, like a ringfinger with an obvious indentation from a wedding ring that isn’t present, or noticing that someone is wearing shoes with no socks.

## Body Language
A person can speak volumes just in the way they move.  Being able to interpret body language can give insights into a mark’s mental state, almost to the point of appearing psychic.

## Notice
Notice is your ability to pick up subtle clues in your environment.  A hidden security camera, a receptionist reaching under a table to trigger a silent alarm, or a small pressure plate under a valuable diamond are all things that could potentially save the outcome of a job with a good Notice score.

## Rep
You have a reputation that precedes you.  There is word on the street about your deeds.  Rep can be both good and bad, and a high score in Rep does not imply that it’s all positive, it just increases the likelihood that someone (including the cops) has heard of you.

## Fasttalk
Fasttalk increases your ability to talk your way out of a jam.  Fasttalk does not replace role playing, rather it is used to augment role playing to determine if your attempt to smooth talk an NPC is successful.

## Research
Research determines how much information you’re able to pull up about a given mark.  Research implies fairly traditional methods of gathering intel, public records, news reports, the internet, whatever is freely available.  Research-gathering is an important part of the setup of the con.

## Dirt
Dirt measures your ability to dig up the good stuff on a mark, the weak points in the façade that you can exploit for the con.  Dirt can come from a variety of places that must be declared and role-played.  Unlike Research, you can’t (generally) do an internet search and find dirt on a person (although there’s always a chance, depending on the mark).  To get dirt on someone, you need to interact with them, their friends, or have the right connections that can provide extra intelligence that will turn a potential mark into the next payoff.
